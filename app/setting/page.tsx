                      known for leading the great protest against
                      Napoleon&apos;s demand that the hens surrender 400 eggs
                      each week to be sold for grain. The demonstration came at
                      a high cost‚Äînine hens lost their lives in the struggle.
                      Inspired by Snowball&apos;s ideals before his exile, Hetty
                      fights for fairness, freedom, and the right of every
                      animal to have a voice.

                      Though relatively inexperienced and not as polished a
                      speaker as Snowball, Hetty&apos;s courage and conviction
                      make her a powerful force for change. A passionate
                      defender of animal rights, she&apos;s not afraid to ruffle

                      all else and expects loyalty from every animal. Though his
                      critics accuse him of tyranny, Napoleon insists that his
                      firm rule is necessary to keep the farm safe, prosperous,
                      and strong. To his supporters, he is not just a leader‚Äîbut
                      the very foundation of Animal Farm&apos;s future.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    In 2025, Animal Farm will hold its first election. Animal
                    Farm operates as a presidential republic. The President
                    serves as head of state and government and appoints a
                    cabinet. The National Assembly is unicameral, with members
                    elected on a proportional basis; it legislates, approves
                    budgets, and oversees the executive. Political life is
                    shaped primarily by two parties, the Pig Directorate and the
                    Animal Resistance. Elections for the presidency and assembly
                    occur every four years, with a two-term limit for
                    presidents; and the elections happen out of sequence, with
                    the presidential election occurring two years after the
                    assembly election. The two main candidates are Hetty (Animal
                    Resistance) and Napoleon (Pig Directorate). Political
                    polling is mainly done by the Independent Polling
                    Association of Animal Farm, a non-partisan organisation.
                    They are widely considered to be accurate and reliable. The
                    Animal Farm flag is depicted as a green field with a hoof
                    and a horn in the upper left corner. The green represents
                    the fields, while the hoof and horn represents the Republic
                    of the Animals.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    The population of Animal Farm is largely concentrated around
                    the farmhouse and main fields, with smaller groups occupying
                    the barns and pastures. Pigs form the ruling class,
                    controlling administration, production, and communication.
                    Horses make up the majority of the labour force, valued for
                    their strength and endurance, while sheep and goats
                    represent the largest voting bloc‚Äîloyal, vocal, and easily
                    influenced. Hens and cows provide essential produce but
                    remain politically restless after years of exploitation.
                    Dogs serve as the security and enforcement arm of
                    government, maintaining strict order under Napoleon&apos;s
                    rule. Minor groups include the cat, pigeons, and Moses the
                    raven, each contributing in unpredictable ways to the
                    farm&apos;s social life and beliefs. Around the borders,
                    wild animals such as rabbits, rats, and wild birds maintain
                    limited contact, observing the farm&apos;s politics from a
                    wary distance. Collectively, the population reflects a rigid
                    but uneasy hierarchy, shaped by labour, loyalty, and the
                    competing visions of Animalism&apos;s future.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Animal Farm&apos;s economy is centrally managed and heavily
                    focused on agricultural production. Grain, milk, and eggs
                    form the core of domestic output, supporting local
                    consumption and limited trade (recently established under
                    Napoleon) with neighbouring human farms. Labour is provided
                    almost entirely by horses, cows, and hens, with productivity
                    overseen by the ruling pigs. Public works projects,
                    including windmill construction and barn expansion, drive
                    periods of growth but often strain resources and labour
                    capacity. Security and enforcement are major state
                    expenditures, maintained by a specialised canine force.
                    While small-scale innovation initiatives, such as new
                    farming techniques promoted by Snowball&apos;s supporters,
                    occasionally surface, most economic activity remains tightly
                    controlled under Napoleon&apos;s leadership, with profits
                    redistributed unevenly across the population.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Journalism on Animal Farm is active but sharply divided
                    along political lines. Two major newspapers dominate the
                    media landscape. The Daily Squealer serves as the official
                    mouthpiece of Napoleon&apos;s administration, promoting
                    state policies and emphasising themes of unity,
                    productivity, and loyalty to leadership. Its coverage often
                    celebrates government achievements and downplays reports of
                    dissent or hardship. In contrast, The Farmyard Voice aligns
                    with the reformist camp and is more aligned with the
                    original values of Animal Farm, as espoused by Snowball in
                    the early days. The Barnyard Voice notably gives space to
                    opposition viewpoints and grassroots concerns. It highlights
                    issues of fairness, animal rights, and democratic reform,
                    frequently adopting a populist and critical tone toward the
                    ruling pigs. Together, the two papers reflect a lively but
                    polarised press environment shaped by ideology, control, and
                    competing visions for the future of Animal Farm.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Animal Farm&apos;s infrastructure is centred around the main
                    barn complex, which serves as the hub for administration,
                    storage, and assembly. A network of dirt tracks links key
                    production areas, including the fields, pasturelands, and
                    windmill site. The windmill remains the largest single
                    development project, supplying limited mechanical power and
                    symbolising the farm&apos;s drive toward modernisation.
                    Water is distributed through shared trough systems, and most
                    transport relies on horse-drawn carts and manual labour.
                    Communication infrastructure is largely informal, with
                    announcements delivered via the Barn Wall social media
                    platform. Plans for expanded power generation and improved
                    grain storage facilities are under discussion, though
                    progress depends heavily on labour availability and
                    Napoleon&apos;s approval.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Education on Animal Farm is overseen by the pigs, who
                    control both curriculum and access to learning. Early
                    literacy programs, introduced after the Rebellion, aimed to
                    teach all animals to read and write, though success has been
                    uneven: horses and sheep retain only simple slogans, while
                    pigs enjoy full fluency and use it to maintain authority.
                    Informal lessons are held in the barn, focusing on
                    obedience, productivity, and the principles of Animalism as
                    interpreted by Napoleon&apos;s leadership. Alternative
                    education initiatives, inspired by Snowball&apos;s original
                    teachings, continue quietly among reformist groups who
                    promote critical thinking and equal access to knowledge.
                    While official policy celebrates &quot;education for
                    all&quot;, the system increasingly reinforces social
                    hierarchy, ensuring the ruling pigs remain the most informed
                    class on the farm.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Culture on Animal Farm is shaped by themes of labour,
                    loyalty, and collective identity. Music and poetry play
                    central roles in community life, with songs such as Beasts
                    of England and later state-approved anthems used to inspire
                    unity and devotion to leadership. Public events (including
                    harvest festivals, flag-raising ceremonies, and anniversary
                    parades) reinforce shared purpose while glorifying the
                    achievements of the ruling pigs. Storytelling and oral
                    traditions persist among the working animals, often
                    celebrating courage, friendship, and quiet resistance.
                    Visual art and slogans, prominently displayed on the
                    physical barn walls and on the social platform of the same
                    name, serve both as propaganda and as expressions of pride
                    in the Rebellion. Despite increasing political control, a
                    small but resilient undercurrent of folk expression
                    continues to reflect the hopes and frustrations of the wider
                    animal community.

                  <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed">
                    Public services on Animal Farm are limited and largely
                    organised through collective labour. Basic needs, such as
                    food distribution, shelter maintenance, and healthcare, are
                    managed by local work groups under supervision from the
                    pigs. Formal welfare systems are minimal, with injured or
                    ageing animals often relying on community support rather
                    than state provision. Security is tightly controlled by
                    Napoleon&apos;s canine guard, who enforce curfews, monitor
                    gatherings, and ensure loyalty to the leadership.
                    Environmental management focuses on maintaining crop yields
                    and protecting grazing land, though soil depletion and
                    overwork remain ongoing concerns. While official reports
                    describe the farm as &quot;self-sustaining and secure&quot;,
                    conditions vary widely across species, reflecting deep
                    inequalities in access to safety, comfort, and care.
